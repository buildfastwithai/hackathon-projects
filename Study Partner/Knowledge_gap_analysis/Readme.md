# Study Partner: Knowledge Gap Analyzer for Educational Progress Tracking

## Build Fast with AI Hackathon Project

**Author:** Anish.K.M
**Team:** Lonewolf
**Project:** Study Partner

**Note:** The output from quizzes or events, such as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) or fill-in-the-blank exercises, should be saved in a **CSV file**. This project processes the CSV file, performing data analysis to identify knowledge gaps in student performance as part of the Knowledge Gap Analyzer.

## Introduction

Welcome to Study Partner, an innovative project developed for the "Build Fast with AI" hackathon. This application serves as a knowledge gap analyzer, designed to revolutionize how we approach education and student performance tracking. As a solo developer (Team Lonewolf), I've embarked on this journey to create a tool that can significantly impact the educational landscape.

Please note that Study Partner is currently in its base version, representing a raw outline of the concept. As a learner myself, diving into new technologies and methodologies, this project showcases the potential of AI in education while also reflecting my growth as a developer.

## Project Overview

Study Partner implements a Knowledge Gap Analyzer, a powerful tool designed to help educators and students identify areas of improvement in the learning process. By analyzing quiz results, this application provides insights into student performance, highlighting strengths and weaknesses across various topics.

The Knowledge Gap Analyzer uses machine learning techniques to process quiz data, offering valuable insights that can guide both teaching strategies and individual learning paths. This tool is particularly useful for:

- Teachers looking to tailor their curriculum based on class performance
- Students seeking to understand their learning progress and focus areas
- Educational institutions aiming to improve overall academic outcomes

**Important Note:** The current implementation uses synthetic data generated by AI to demonstrate the capabilities of the Knowledge Gap Analyzer. This approach allows for a proof of concept without the need for real student data at this stage of development. In a production environment, it would be crucial to use real, anonymized student data for accurate insights, always ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and analysis of quiz results
- Machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) for performance prediction
- Visualization of key performance indicators
- Identification of weak areas and learning gaps
- Time management analysis for quiz-taking strategies
- Impact assessment of multiple attempts on question accuracy

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/anishkm/study-partner.git
   cd study-partner
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Generate synthetic data (or use your own data):
   - Run the first cell in the Jupyter notebook to generate a synthetic dataset.
   - If using your own data, ensure it's in CSV format with similar columns to the synthetic data.

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Study_Partner_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the cells in order to:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Train and evaluate machine learning models
   - Analyze feature importance
   - Visualize key relationships in the data
   - Generate insights and recommendations

4. Interpret the results and apply insights to improve educational strategies.

## Customization

- To use your own quiz data, replace the data generation step with your data loading process.
- Modify the `preprocess_data` function to handle any specific requirements of your dataset.
- Adjust the visualizations and analyses to focus on aspects most relevant to your educational context.

## Current Limitations and Future Work

As a base version and learning project, Study Partner has several areas for improvement and expansion:

1. **Data Source**: Currently using synthetic data. Future versions aim to incorporate real, anonymized student data for more accurate insights.
2. **Model Refinement**: The machine learning models can be further optimized and expanded to improve prediction accuracy.
3. **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface is planned to make the tool more accessible to educators and students.
4. **Additional Features**: More advanced analytics, personalized learning path suggestions, and integration with existing educational platforms are on the roadmap.

## Benefits

1. **Personalized Learning**: Identify individual student strengths and weaknesses to create tailored learning plans.
2. **Curriculum Optimization**: Gain insights to refine course content and teaching methodologies.
3. **Early Intervention**: Spot struggling students early and provide timely support.
4. **Resource Allocation**: Direct educational resources more effectively based on identified needs.
5. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor student progress over time and measure the impact of interventions.
6. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Empower educators with actionable insights from quiz performance data.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS) for real-time data analysis
- Incorporation of more advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning models
- Development of a user-friendly web interface for easy access by educators and administrators
- Implementation of predictive analytics to forecast student performance and potential challenges
