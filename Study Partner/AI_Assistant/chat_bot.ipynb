It was named after Alex Krizhevsky and was submitted to the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge on September 30, 2012. The network achieved a top-5 error of 15.3%, which was more than 10.8 percentage points lower than that of the runner up. The architecture of AlexNet is known for its depth, which was made feasible due to the utilization of graphics processing units (GPUs) during training. The network consists of convolutional layers (with ReLU activation), local response normalization, maxpooling, fully connected layers (with ReLU activation), and dropout. The original AlexNet paper was published in 2012 and has been cited over 157,000 times as of mid-2024, making it one of the most influential papers in the field of computer vision.\n",
