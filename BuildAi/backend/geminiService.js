   - If the code is correct, provide both time complexity (TC) and space complexity (SC) of the code.
   - Suggest a more optimized solution if applicable, explaining why itâ€™s more efficient.

2. If the code is incorrect:
   - Return a new corrected code version.
   - Point out mistakes in the user's code with short comments inside the code (explaining what went wrong).
   - After fixing the code, give a more optimized solution (if possible) and explain why the new approach is better in terms of efficiency.`;
